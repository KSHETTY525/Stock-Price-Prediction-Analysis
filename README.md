Developed an interactive stock price prediction web app using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Performed data preprocessing and visualization using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. Implemented regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to forecast stock prices based on historical data. Deployed the model through a user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time input and prediction.
